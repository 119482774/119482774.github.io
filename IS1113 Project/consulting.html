	<h1> Consultancy </h1>
	<p> Online consulting is a very vast term. It covers a considerable amount of jobs. Jobs that usually appear due to the market demand. Honestly, everyone with a decent knowledge on a particular topic can become a consultant on it.

	The Oxford Dictionary provides a definition of a consultant: “A person who provides expert advice professionally.” This does not sound complicated, doesn’t it? What is more, an expert advice does not necessarily have to come from the mouth of an expert! However weird this may seem to you, try to reconsider.

	First of all, in today’s world, it is very hard to keep up with the development of technology. Thus, becoming an expert in a certain field requires constantly updating information. And with this rapid development of technology, it is quite easy to do so. It won’t be that big of an overinterpretation to claim that
	everyone can become an expert now. It, of course, requires a lot of studying, patience, and self-confidence. You will most likely have to take risks and sometimes count on your luck. But with enough tenacity, you will succeed and then you will quickly realize that the struggle was worth it.</p>
